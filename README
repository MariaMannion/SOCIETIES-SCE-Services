The vision of the SOCIETIES project is to research and develop a concept of Ambient Intelligent (AmI) Communities that extend ambient intelligent or pervasive systems beyond the individual to dynamic communities of users. Driven by context awareness, preference learning and privacy protection, AmI Communities will intelligently connect people & things to communicate, share, consume and organise communities. SOCIETIES will embrace online community services, such as Social Networking, thus offering new and powerful ways of working, communicating and socialising. The project intends developing and trialling use cases for disaster management, university living and conference support.

This SOCIETIES SCE & Services repository will host the Service Creation Environment and the 3rd party services that will showcase the SOCIETIES Platform that can be used by the outside world - researchers, developers and users.
